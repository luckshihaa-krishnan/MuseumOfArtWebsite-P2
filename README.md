## MUSEUM OF ART - PART 2

#### Published URL : https://luckshihaakrishnan-museumofartwebsitep2.onrender.com


This is the fourth project I did in the course which is a continuation of 'Museum Of Art - Part 1' (https://github.com/luckshihaa-krishnan/MuseumOfArtWebsite-P1). In this application, I added more features which are adding favourites and a search history. This allows users to favourite their desired artwork card and allows users to view their search history of what they have searched either in the advanced search form or the search bar.

To favourite an artwork card, the user would go into the artwork details and at the bottom, there is a button to favor or unfavour the artwork card. To view all the favourite artworks, there is a drop down on the top right corner of the application, beside the search bar, which can direct the user to the favourites page or the search history page, based on which one the user chooses to view. In the search history page, the user has the advantage to delete a search as there is a red X on the right side of the search text. The user also has the ability to click on any search in the search history and it will redirect them to the artwork cards that match the search.

Overall, I think adding the favourites and search history feature is an advantage for users as they can view their favourite artworks and what they have searched for when they have opened the application.

The command to run this application is 'npm run dev'. After this command is typed in the terminal, it will give a link to where we can see the application (for example, localhost:3000). This link would lead us to the application in the browser.
